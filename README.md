## Raspberry Pi Controlled Robot, inspired by the 'Camjam Edukit 3'

This project was initially going planned as a write-up of what I finished up making with the CamJam Edukit 3. For those who are not familiar with the kit, it essentially is a bunch of components to allow you to create a two-wheeler robot using a Raspberry Pi, as the brains of the operation.

The main selling point of the kit are the step by step instructions that are available for download and produced with associates from Cambridge University, and if these guys don’t know what they’re doing, then there’s not much hope for us, is there! As a precursor to the ‘EduKit 3’, there are edukits 1 and 2 which provides you with some sensors ie. PIR, Temperature and ultrasound sensors, and all the wires, resistors and buttons that you need to connect with the Raspberry Pi.
